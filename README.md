Scarneâ€™s Dice is a turn-based dice game where players score points by rolling a die and then::
------------------------------------------------------------
* If they roll a 1, score no points and lose their turn
* If they roll a 2 to 6:
  * add the rolled value to their points
  * choose to either reroll or keep their score and end their turn
The winner is the first player that reaches (or exceeds) 100 points.
